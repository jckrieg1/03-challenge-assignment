## Description
My motivation to complete this project was to practive and better my skills in HTML and CSS as well as practice building a webpage from scratch. I built this project to begin creating my professional portfolio. This project is the beginning of my work portfolio and will be updated and edited as my skills improve. I learned about using classes and ids, building a webpage, link fuctions, as well as pseudoclasses.
